So to make it for me clear :)

I'm using XMonad... and did run in some trouble.. and some overaltrouble that i want to aviod in future
so I will create this file as reminder for me.

To get sharedclipboard and some useful things as resizing and other stuff add:
'''
VBoxClient-all &
'''
into you ~/.xinitrc.

I recomend using "unclutter" from arch repos(no need to configure it, just download package and add this
to your ~/.xinitrc
'''
unclutter &
'''
if this is not working for you, on Arch Wiki is fix for it.

Sorry for my terrible english :P
